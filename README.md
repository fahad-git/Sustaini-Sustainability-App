# Sustaini - Sustainable Product Shopping App

## Overview
Sustaini is a mobile application designed to promote eco-friendly and sustainable practices by connecting users with sustainable products and businesses. Developed as part of the **IMT4309: Usability and Human Factors in Interaction Design** course at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), this project follows **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** principles to ensure a user-friendly, accessible, and engaging experience. The app empowers users to discover, purchase, and share sustainable products while fostering a community around sustainable living.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of Sustaini are to:
- Enable users to **find, search, and buy eco-friendly products** with advanced filtering options.
- Allow users to **set sustainability goals** and earn **rewards** for achieving them.
- Provide **educational content** on sustainability in an engaging, non-traditional format.
- Foster a **community** for sharing tips, experiences, and product recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Product Search and Filtering**: Advanced search functionality with sustainability-focused filters.
- **Goal Setting and Rewards**: Users can set sustainability goals and earn badges for completing tasks.
- **Community Engagement**: Share favorite products, post thoughts, and interact with a sustainability-focused community.
- **Accessible Design**: Adheres to Universal Design principles, ensuring inclusivity for diverse users, with AAA-level contrast (WCAG-compliant).
- **Hassle-Free Access**: No login required to browse products, ensuring cost-free and seamless access.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Intuitive interface with familiar icons and clear information presentation.

## Design Process
The development of Sustaini followed the **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** methodology, which includes:
1. **Discover**: Conducted user research through surveys and interviews with 16 participants aged 18–40 to identify pain points and needs.
2. **Define**: Formulated a problem statement and created personas (Ben, Natalia, Max) to represent the target audience.
3. **Design**: Developed low-fidelity wireframes and iterated to high-fidelity designs using **Figma**.
4. **Prototype and Testing**: Created a low-fidelity prototype, conducted usability testing with 5 participants, and refined the design based on feedback.
5. **Plan and Implement**: Finalized a high-fidelity prototype incorporating **Nielsen's Heuristics** and **Gestalt Principles** for optimal usability and aesthetics.

### Usability Testing
- **Low-Fidelity Testing**: Conducted with 5 participants, yielding an average **System Usability Scale (SUS)** score of 87.5 (Grade B, "Good").
- **Feedback Implementation**: Improved navigation, checkout process, and community features based on user suggestions, such as adding order tracking and more payment options.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Ensured AAA-level contrast using WebAIM's Contrast Checker and incorporated clear visual elements for inclusivity.

## Universal Design Principles
Sustaini’s design adheres to **Universal Design principles**, ensuring accessibility for users with diverse abilities:
- **Perceivable**: High-contrast colors (AAA-level, WCAG-compliant) and clear visual elements.
- **Operable**: Intuitive navigation with familiar icons and undo functionalities for critical actions.
- **Understandable**: Simple language, consistent design, and minimal cognitive load.
- **Robust**: Compatible across devices with reliable performance and error prevention.
